<h1>The Best Movies according to Siddharth </h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>HRIDAYAM</h3>
<p>The Og Malyalam movie one should definitely watch. Teachs about college life from the start to the end still you get a satisfactory job. Teachs how to enjoy life.</p>
<h3>DJ TILLU</h3>
<p>This is a no-brainer, absolute fun and hungama. (mom's fav)</p>
<h3>RRR</h3>
<P>The direction of the film, the story is just great. You're missing out on some serious stuff if you didnt watch this yet!</P>
